  - Store symbol data in MongoDB, fetched via API.

#### b. **Interactive Quiz Module**

- **Features:**
  - Present multiple-choice questions based on symbols.
  - Provide immediate feedback and explanations.
  - Track user scores and progress.

- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Randomize questions and answer options.
  - Store quiz data and user responses in MongoDB.

#### c. **Control Sheet Simulator Module**

- **Features:**
  - Allow users to practice interpreting full control description sheets.
  - Enable users to input their interpretations and receive feedback.

- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Render control sheets using SVG or high-resolution images.
  - Implement touch interactions for user inputs.

#### d. **User Profile & Progress Tracking Module**

- **Features:**
  - Display user statistics, achievements, and progress over time.
  - Allow users to set learning goals and track completion.

- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Securely store user data in MongoDB.
  - Use Firebase Authentication for user management.

### 4. **Asset Management**

- **Extraction:**
  - Utilize PDF parsing tools to extract symbol images from the IOF Control Descriptions 2024 PDF.
  - Convert extracted symbols to SVG format for scalability and clarity.

- **Optimization:**
  - Compress images to reduce app size and improve performance.
  - Ensure consistent naming conventions for easy retrieval.

- **Storage:**
  - Host assets on Firebase Storage with appropriate access controls.

### 5. **Security Considerations**

- **Authentication:**
  - Implement Firebase Authentication with email/password and social login options.

- **Data Protection:**
  - Use HTTPS for all API communications.
  - Encrypt sensitive user data in the database.

- **Access Control:**
  - Implement role-based access controls for administrative functionalities.

### 6. **Performance Optimization**

- **Lazy Loading:** Load components and data as needed to reduce initial load time.

- **Caching:** Implement caching strategies for static assets and API responses.

- **Code Splitting:** Split code into manageable chunks to improve load times.

### 7. **Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Testing:** Test individual components and functions using Jest.

- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between components and modules.

- **End-to-End Testing:** Use tools like Detox for simulating user interactions.

### 8. **Deployment Plan**

- **Development Environment:** Set up local development environments with emulators for iOS and Android.

- **Continuous Integration:** Use GitHub Actions to automate testing and builds.

- **App Stores:** Prepare for deployment to Google Play Store and Apple App Store, adhering to their guidelines.

With this technical specification in place, we're well-prepared to proceed to the next phase: extracting and preparing the necessary assets from the IOF Control Descriptions 2024 PDF. Once the assets are ready, we can integrate them into the app using VS Code and Cline. Shall we move on to the asset extraction phase?
