This file contain the instructions for the work day, what want to achieve and what was done, this file should be udated by the AI and operator constantly to be sure we are working on the same context.

## Goal of today session

### Overview
- MVP is running locally, the main goal of the day would be to configure the rest of tooling around: testing, deploying, updating pipeline, continuous integration, ...
- no new feature work until all the tooling is done

### Success criteria
- Operator can test the app on Android
- Operator can test the app on web online
- Operator can deploy on mobile and web easily
- App is protected by critcal path end to end tests

- ✅ Web deployment configuration with GitHub Pages
- 🔄 Mobile app deployment with EAS Build
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

#### 🔄 Branching & Release Strategy
- ✅ Implement Git Flow branching model
- ✅ Configure builds to trigger only on specific branches/tags
- ✅ Set up automatic versioning for releases

#### 🔄 Testing & Quality
- ✅ Unit tests for core functionality
- 🔄 Integration tests for key user flows
- 📝 End-to-end testing with Detox

### Additional Items to Consider

#### ✅ Environment Configuration

- ✅ Managing environment variables across platforms

#### ✅ Web Hosting Setup
- ✅ Selecting a hosting provider (GitHub Pages)
- 📝 Domain configuration if needed

#### 🔄 Performance Monitoring
- 📝 Implementing basic analytics or error tracking
- 📝 Setting up performance monitoring tools (like Firebase Performance)

#### 🔄 Security Considerations

## Current Progress

### Today's Achievements
- ✅ Unit tests setup and Jest configuration for React Native
- ✅ Unit tests created for critical utility functions
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD setup
- ✅ Separated web and Android build workflows for better reliability
- ✅ Webpack configuration updated for GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ Created documentation for deployment, testing, and app store submission
- ✅ Implemented environment handling for development and production builds
- ✅ Created placeholder app icons and splash screens for Android build
- ✅ Set up eas.json configuration for EAS builds
- ✅ Fixed Metro development server image loading issues

### Tomorrow's Plan
- 🔄 Implement branching strategy to control when builds are triggered
- ✅ Configure EAS Build in GitHub Actions for Android deployment
- 📝 Create release workflow for versioned app releases
- 📝 Document the release process for team members

### Challenges and Solutions
- ✅ Resolved test configuration issues with Jest by switching from jest-expo to react-native preset
- ✅ Fixed webpack configuration to handle asset copying more robustly
- ✅ Identified issues with direct Android builds in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Decided to use Expo's EAS Build service for more reliable Android builds
  - Android builds can be triggered using: `eas build --platform android`
  - Check if you're already logged in with: `eas whoami`
  - If not logged in, use: `eas login`
  - Issue encountered: Invalid eas.json configuration with error "build.preview.android.applicationId is not allowed"
  - Solution: Remove the invalid "applicationId" property from the preview profile in eas.json. The correct way to set the application ID is using "android.package" in app.json/app.config.js
- ✅ Created necessary icon and splash screen assets for Android builds
- ✅ Fixed asset loading in Metro development server through improved configuration
